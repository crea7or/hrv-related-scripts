Only one format is supported now, plain text with numbers(one per line) that contain RR intervals:

This format is used by a few software products including EliteHrv and Kubios.

dx - difference between higher and lower RRs

RMSSD - root mean square of RR differences

ln(RMSSD) - natural logarithm from RMSSD

min HR - minimal heart rate detected

max HR - maximal HR detected

## What's inside?

stats.php - the main script that process txt files in the current directory and output to the console. Have a few defines to detect errors.

fix.php - script that fix txt files in current directory (commented out for safety).
